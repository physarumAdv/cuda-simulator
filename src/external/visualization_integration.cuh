 * coordinates]}`. For example, to represent two particles with coordinates (0, 0, 0) and (0.5, 1, 2), the following
 * JSON is generated: `{"x": [0.000000, 0.500000], "y": [0.000000, 1.000000], "z": [0.000000, 2.000000]}`. Then it is
 * sent to the given url as an HTTP POST request with `Content-Type: application/json`
 *
 * @param urls HTTP url to send data to (protocols different from http are not supported)
 * @param nodes Pointer-represented array of nodes from the simulation (probably) containing particles
 * @param n_of_nodes Number of elements in the `nodes` array
 *
 * @returns `true` if the request was successfully sent, `false` if there was an exception from the http lib (it will
 *      be caught and printed to stderr)
 *
 * @note This function was not designed to be used in various contexts different from the simulation's main flow, were
 *      it's needed to send the data to visualization and only know, whether it was sent successfully or not (the
 *      end-user will see the error in stderr if it exists, but the function caller won't be able to handle it, because
 *      it's handled inside of `send_particles_to_visualization`). The reason for this decision is to reduce code
 *      duplication (because there are two main functions for cpp and cuda), which might mean for you that you don't
 *      want to use this function but want to write your own request sender
